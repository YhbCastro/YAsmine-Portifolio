        <h3>About Yasmine</h3> <!--Write about me, interests, reason to get in to coding -->
        <article>
          <p>I'm from Brazil and came to the U.S. 2 years ago. In Brazil, I got a bachelor's degree in Biomedicine and started working as a geneticist in a biotechnology lab. After 2 years, I decided I wanted to move to the United States and found the easiest way was to become an AuPair (live-in nanny).</p>
          <p>I worked as an AuPair for 1.5 years and decided it was time to transition into a career, and decided to look into programming. I started learning programming languages by myself using codecademy but wanted to take it one step further by signing up for a coding bootcamp.</p>
          <p>As I was learning more about programing I realized how much I enjoy thinking about solutions for the problems presented to me, as someone that plays a lot of video games that is something that I was already used to.</p>
          <p>The bootcamp gave me more knowledge and confidence in my skills, and I keep learning new things every day. As I progress I feel more and more prepared to start my new career.</p>
          <p>If you are looking to hire someone motivated and willing to learn, give me a chance and I will prove I'm worth it!</p>
